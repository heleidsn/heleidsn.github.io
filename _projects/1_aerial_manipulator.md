Aerial manipulators, combining quadrotors with robotic arms, have gained attention for tasks like inspection, manipulation, and transportation. 

Accurate trajectory tracking is important for aerial manipulator application; however, it is challenging due to the coupling between the quadrotor dynamics and the robotic arm, especially during object manipulation.

Our object is to develop an adaptive control framework to improve trajectory tracking accuracy under dynamic coupling and disturbances caused by heavy-object grasping.
