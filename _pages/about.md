Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜ƒ

I am Lei He (ä½•ç£Š), currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/), [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), supervised by Assistant Professor [Lin Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/lzhao). My research focuses on aerial manipulators, motion planning, model predictive control (MPC), and autonomous system control, aiming to enhance the autonomous operational capabilities of aerial robots in complex environments.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [School of Aeronautics](https://hangkong.nwpu.edu.cn/EN/Home.htm), [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2023, supervised by Prof. [Bifeng Song](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bifeng-Song). Before that, I recieved my bachelorâ€™s degree at the [Honors College](https://enhonors.nwpu.edu.cn/), Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). During my Ph.D. studies, I was a CSC Joint Ph.D. Student at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. [Nabil Aouf](https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/about/people/academics/nabil-aouf) and Prof. [James Whidborne](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/people/professor-james-whidborne-400615), where I further expanded my expertise in autonomous system using deep reinforcement learning.

Beyond my research, I have a strong passion for aircraft, aerial photography, and drone flight. I enjoy exploring advanced flight technologies and capturing the world from unique aerial perspectives. If you are interested in my research or related topics, feel free to reach out for discussions!
